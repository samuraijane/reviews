My Scouting Journey
December 9, 2024

My scouting journey begins when I was trying to find an excuse to get out of another year of piano from my mom. I used the program as a scapegoat to try and make my way out of having to go through an entire year of struggling to learn this instrument. I still had to do piano but little did I know I was about to make the best decision I've ever made in my life. This is my scouting story.

It all started a year before I was able to join when we went to an open house at a fire station. I met a couple explorers that told me and my family about the program. At first, I wasn't so sure I wanted to join. Then a little later, I knew I wasn't going to join. But with the start of the school year creeping around the corner, my mom made deal with me that if I found a different activity to do, I wouldn't have to do piano that year.

I was in my room struggling to think of things that I would enjoy doing that wouldn't cost an arm and a leg. And then it hit me, the Explorers program is the perfect idea! At the time, I viewed the program as something easy. Once I learned how much hard work it involves, though, I realized I was very mistaken. I came running down the hall to tell my mom about the idea and she thought it was perfect. As soon as we found out where the training center was, we rushed down there to get the paperwork we needed and filled it out.

I distinctly remember my first Day as an explorer. It was probably one of the most difficult Tuesdays I've ever experienced in my life. I was so nervous to begin, especially because of my size and how out of shape I was. I was positive I was going to get run over that day.

During the first 15 minutes, we did some PT that was supposed to be simple but for me at the time, it was not. I remember being so relieved when we were done because my arms and legs felt like noodles from all the running and push-ups. After that, we were instructed to do quick dress but I had no idea what I was doing and ince we had already started, it was a little too late to ask questions. Luckily, though, when we went to get paperwork earlier, I was watching them all do quick dress and I had a slight idea of what was about to happen. It took me 3 minutes and 58 seconds to get in my gear and I still did it wrong. All eyes were on me.

After struggling my way out of quick dress, I looked at my watch and realized I still had 2 1/2 more hours of this! After receiving instructions at the obstacle course where we would continue to train, I remember feeling ready. But when it was my turn, I was handed this huge air pack and was confused. Then I realized I had to wear this giant thing on my back all the way through this obstacle course! Once I had gone through, I was exhausted.

When my turn was over, one of my advisers pulled me and a couple other kids aside and told us all to stand in a line. We were about to practice quick dress again! I was so relieved I didn't have to go through the obstacle course one more time– I probably would have passed out. But I did get a few good tips on how to shave my time down from about four minutes to one minute and 45 seconds. When I went home, I was so relieved that training was over.

The timing of when I started just happened to be when they started training for a competition coming up the next year. Over the course of the next few months, I became the fastest at knots, got my quick dress time down to 36 seconds, and was on the number one team for 5 out of the 8 events.

Pulling into Gatlinburg for the BSA Winterfest competition a flood of so many emotions started rushing in. I was excited, nervous, and really tired all at the same time. We started the next morning with a scavenger hunt. We were put into teams and set off. It was a very fun activity to start the day and it helped build friendships and bonds while working very fast.

While we were waiting for the opening ceremony to start, I noticed a group of cadets struggling to drag a dummy across the room. As I watched them, it was easy for me to put myself in their shoes because not long ago I was also struggling to drag a dummy across the room. I decided to go over and help show them how to properly pick up and drag the dummy while saving time, energy, and their backs. While we were chatting about it, their adviser noticed and decided to come over to see what was happening. They explained the situation and he thanked me for helping them and how it made a very big difference. In that moment I felt this great wave of happiness wash over me and I can only hope that the feeling I had when I went to help them is the same feeling they will experience when they find someone needing help.

On the day of the competition we showed up to the arena which was very loud and busy with all the different countys preparing to compete against one another. We got to our station, set everything up, and began. All the competitions were very hard and tested every skill I had learned during the past 4 1/2 months. But we all made it through with smiles on our faces and brought home friendships, a couple trophies, and a new record for one of the drills.

It was a breath of fresh air to come back home after Winterfest but I missed  the rush of adrenaline at the same time. For the next couple of months, things were pretty easy. We did a bunch of EMS training, updated some certifications, and learned the basic skills to help someone who needs medical attention.

Towards the end of the school year we needed to get new officers– captain, lieutenants, and sergeants. A lot of my fellow explorers believed I would be a great 2nd Lieutenant so I decided to run for it. When it came time to vote, I was a little nervous to see what would happen. The silence was so loud when the advisers came out with that small sheet of paper to announce who our next captain and first lieutenant would be. The stress was getting worse with each person who went up. When it was my turn, I went up and gave my speech for the position of second Lieutenant. Even though my knees were shaking I was able to muster up the right words and get my speech out.

While everyone was voting, it felt like my heart was about to beat out of my chest and when the advisers came out with that small sheet of paper, it felt like time was moving in slow motion. As they opened the piece of paper and read who was going to be the next second Lieutenant, they called out my name. My heart dropped with excitement and a little bit of fear for what the future would hold.

Summer break was finally here and it was nice to have some time off after the Winterfest competition. Then came the Academy– an entire week of morning-to-evening training, putting out some controlled fires, and a lot of PT. The first day of Academy was the longest day of PT. We had an hour of running, pushups, towers, and a lot more. When that was done, it was time to get to work. That day we did hydrant hookup, quick dress, climbed a 100 foot ladder, and learned about knots.

Over the course of the next few days we gained experience with a number of new skills. We learned how to properly crawl through windows, work with each set of hoses, put out a car fire, and execute a forcible entry. We also learned about ventilation and watched a dollhouse fire and all of this was before lunch.

After we ate, we were in the classroom to learn about ride along requirements, VEIS and fire dynamics, HIPAA, pus, and feces. But the thing that kept me going through all of this was not the idea of wanting to get over my fears and push past my limits– it was the thought of the amount of PT that the scary man with the mustache at the bottom of the ladder would make me do if I didn't.

After finally making it to Friday we had one more day to get through before the week was officially over. On Saturday, we ended the week with skills related to working building fires like hydrant hookup, forcible entry, ventilation, ladders, and search and rescue. At the end, we put out a dumpster fire.

When it was all said and done, we packed up and left feeling exhausted but accomplished at the same time. We built strong bonds with people who had been there for a while and with people who had just joined at the beginning of the week. We all grew together as a team throughout the time we spent with each other training for our future.

Looking back, I realized that if I didn't have that small nudge of trying to find that one thing to get out of another thing, I wouldn't have been where I am today. I look at the accomplishments I've made throughout the year as the second lieutenant in the Cherokee Fire Explorer Program and I know now that this is by far the best decision I have ever made. And that is my scouting journey.
